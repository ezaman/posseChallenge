# posseChallenge

This is a simple app where I created a programmatic collectionview of Posse employees. It includes:

- SwiftyJSON to parse the JSON file and retrieve information
- Pictures of employees to match information
- Visual format language for constraints
- Simple animation when user taps on each cell
